# DTR: Define the Relationship

## Peerat Sukcharoenyingyong and Naomi Campos

## Star Wars API - Trivia - Rise of Skywalker

### Memo:

- Communicate via Slack and in person
- Daily meetings after school
- Communicate what we are working on and reach out for help if needed (especially to stay on track with the learning goals and MVP we need to hit)
- Keep track of learning goals in mind in approaching the project
- Raise any concerns we might have early and in advance so we can work through the differences we may have in our approach

### Learning Goals

- Write squeaky clean, well refactored code using ES6 syntax.
- Make informed design decisions to create a user-friendly application.
- Keep state based components to a minimum and leverage more functional components.
- Use a modular architecture for your application file structure.
- Think deeply about React Lifecycle Methods.
- Become familiar with promises, nested fetch requests, and handling the UI based on acceptance of data.
- Become familiar with routing and how to handle dynamic routes.
- Use propTypes for every component receiving props.
- Write tests for React components, asynchronous functionality, and route handling.
